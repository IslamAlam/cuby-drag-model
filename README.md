# Cuby

Git repository for the Cuby project

- make sure you have Git installed
- make sure to understand how git is used (branches, merge requests, etc.). There are plenty of online tutorials and it's not complicated. If you have any questions, ask :)
- never (!!!) work in the master branch. Whenever you want to add something (e.g. a new function) create a new branch. If you're done with the new feature, create a merge request!

## Connect the repository with Matlab

1. Open Matlab
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to keep the repo
3. Create a directory with the name you want to have for the repo (e.g. "Cuby")
4. Navigate into this newly create directory in Matlab
5. Right click on the empty space in this directory in Matlab (in the area where the files would be, if there were any)
6. Choose "Source Control" -> "Manage Files..."
7. Keep "Source control integration" as "git"
8. Insert the https adress of the repo in "Repository Path" (you find that in Gitlub. If you're in the Cuby repo, click the "Clone" button and copy the https adress)
9. Click "Retrive"
10. Enter your Gitlab credentials
11. Done. The repo should now be on your computer.
